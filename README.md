# Task Planner :

Basic Taskplanner inspired by the to-do list created in [Vue.js](https://vuejsexamples.com/advanced-to-do-list-application-built-with-vue-js/).

The app was created as part of [Generation Australia](https://australia.generation.org/programs/become-a-web-developer/) final assessment.

## Technical description :

### Languages and frameworks :

Task Planner is written with :

- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- Bootstrap 4.5
- Vanilla JS

It also uses :

- [Local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to keep the created, updated and deleted tasks saved in the browser. When the user opens Task planner, all the created tasks will be there.
- [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html) - web application bundler.
